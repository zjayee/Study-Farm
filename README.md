Study Farm is a studying app which uses the gamification method to increase user engagement and motivation in the studying process. The use of game mechanics is said to increase the ability to learn new skills by 40% ([Gabe Zichermann](https://www.businessinsider.com/gamification-techniques-increase-your-employees-ability-to-learn-by-40-2013-9)). In Study Farm we use a quest-based system to earn coins and prizes, with a gacha game to win characters and objects to place on their in-game farm. Combined with a calendar, task organizer and timer; Study Farm aims to provide a space to manage ongoing tasks while tracking long-term studying progress. 

With StudyFarm, you can see your very own farm come to life. Remember to feed your cows and water your crops by studying hard. How innovative will your farm be?
